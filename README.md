# Brain Connectivity Course
NBE-E4530 - Special Course in Human Neuroscience V / Human brain connectivity
10.04.2018 â€“ 17.05.2018 @ Aalto University

## Expectations
Over the years I've accumulated a basic theoretical understanding of brain connectivity measures. From this course I'm hoping to get finally some practical experience with these methods. In the hands-on sessions I'm hoping to do some sort of directed connectivity analysis.

The course seems to be starting well, as I've also had a "theoretical" undestanding of GitHub but never took the time to actually do some hands-on work. But now, here we are.

And here's a course relevant comic:
